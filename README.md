# LongCOVID_bulkRNAseq_meta-analysis

This repository contains the results and analysis code for our meta-analysis of bulk RNA-seq studies on COVID-19 immune cells.

## Folder Structure

- `results/`  
  Differential expression, Gene Ontology (GO), and KEGG pathway results by comparison.

- `code/`  
  Scripts for preprocessing, differential expression analysis, gene annotation, functional analyses, and statistical analyses.  
  *All code is provided as templatesâ€”you must update file paths and parameters for your datasets.*

## Usage

All shell and R scripts are templates. You must adjust file paths, filenames, and parameters to fit your datasets and environment.
